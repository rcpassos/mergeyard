# Configuration package

`internal/config.Load(path)` loads an explicit path. With an empty path it searches
`./mergeyard.yaml`, then `~/.config/mergeyard/config.yaml`. Only a missing file
falls through; unreadable or invalid files return an error. Files are selected,
not combined. "Global config" in the PRD means top-level fields in the selected
file. `mergeyard.example.yaml` lists all defaults and demonstrates overrides.

`Parse(data)` and `Load(path)` return a resolved `Config` and the source
`Document`. Top-level fields override built-in defaults; each repository inherits
the global roles, labels, and concurrency, then overrides explicitly supplied
fields. `enabled` defaults to true. An empty `BaseBranch` means discovery is
deferred to runtime. Workspace paths retain their configured spelling; the
workspace package is responsible for expanding `~` when using them.

Model and effort strings pass through to the selected harness without a catalog.
`null` clears a model or effort override. An explicit empty `skills` list clears
inherited skills. Unknown keys are tolerated and retained. Known configuration
sections must be mappings with unique string keys; YAML merge keys (`<<`) are
rejected rather than silently ignored. Ordinary anchors and aliases can be read.

## Editing configuration

Start with the `Document` returned by loading the user's file; for a new config,
use `Parse([]byte("{}"))`. Use `Document.Set` to change individual fields:

```go
_, doc, err := config.Load("")
if err != nil { return err }
err = doc.Set([]string{"implementer", "agent"}, "codex")
if err != nil { return err }
err = doc.Set([]string{"repositories", "-"}, map[string]string{
    "repo": "owner/new-repo",
})
if err != nil { return err }
return doc.Write(doc.Path)
```

Path segments are mapping keys or zero-based sequence indices. `-` appends to an
existing sequence; missing mapping parents are created. Replacing an entire
mapping or sequence replaces its children, so edit leaves or append repositories
to keep existing comments and unknown fields. Edits through aliases are rejected;
edit the anchor's original field instead. Resolved `Config` values do not change
when the document is edited; reload after saving to get the new effective config.

`Write(path)` revalidates the edited document, writes a temporary file in the same
directory, and renames it over the destination. Invalid edits leave the original
file intact. Parent directories are created with mode `0700`; new files use
`0600`, and existing file permission bits are retained. Concurrent external edits
are not merged; reload before editing if another process may have changed it.

The writer preserves unknown fields, comments attached to retained nodes, key
order, and styles of unchanged nodes. It does not promise byte-for-byte formatting:
the YAML encoder normalizes indentation and may reposition comments or blank lines.

## Stable errors

Use `errors.As(err, &configError)` with `var configError *config.Error`. `Code`
is stable, `Path` identifies the file or configuration field, and `Unwrap`
retains underlying I/O errors. Validation applies to global and repository role
settings, including repositories with `enabled: false`.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `config.not_found` | Selected file is missing, or neither search location exists |
| `config.read_failed` | File or home-directory lookup failed |
| `config.invalid_yaml` | Syntax, document shape, duplicate keys, or field type is invalid |
| `config.invalid_repo` | Repository must be an `owner/repo` slug |
| `config.invalid_agent` | Agent must be `claude` or `codex` |
| `config.invalid_concurrency` | Concurrency must be a positive finite integer |
| `config.invalid_max_rounds` | Round limit must be a positive finite integer |
| `config.invalid_max_attempts` | Role attempt limit must be a positive finite integer |
| `config.invalid_max_waits` | Usage-limit wait bound must be a positive finite integer |
| `config.invalid_duration` | Poll interval or cooldown must parse as a Go duration |
| `config.invalid_permission_mode` | Claude permission mode must be `auto`, `acceptEdits`, or `bypassPermissions` |
| `config.invalid_sandbox` | Codex sandbox must be `workspace-write` or `danger-full-access` |
| `config.invalid_path` | Document edit path cannot be traversed |
| `config.write_failed` | YAML encoding or atomic file write failed |

Tool versions and harness capability checks belong to runtime/adapter validation;
this package performs no external commands or GitHub calls.
